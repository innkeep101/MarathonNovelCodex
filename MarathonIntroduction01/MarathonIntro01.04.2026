# Marathon — Project Guide

## The Book

Historical fiction set in Athens, 514–490 BCE. Pheidippides is the legendary runner who ran to Sparta and back before the Battle of Marathon — and then, according to legend, ran 26 miles to announce victory and died.

In our version, he's secretly the illegitimate son of Hipparchus (the tyrant's brother, killed when Pheidippides was a child). He doesn't know this. The novel follows a *nothos* — a bastard excluded from the democracy he'll die to save — who runs to prove he belongs, and discovers he's the son of everything democracy was built to destroy.

## Why He Runs to Death

Pheidippides carries shame he didn't choose — *nothos* status, a dead mother with secrets, a father he'll learn was the enemy of everything he believes in.

He runs to earn *kleos*, glory that might redeem a bloodline he can't escape. But *kleos* is selfish — it's glory for you, your name carved in stone. The arc is that he starts running for recognition and ends running for sacrifice. By the end, he no longer needs Athens to remember him. The act is enough.

The death run isn't suicide. It's transformation. He runs himself out of the human world and into legend.

## Core Themes

### 1. Any Man vs. Every Man

Democracy promises that *every man* is equal, but survives because *any man* can be extraordinary. The lie is pretending these are the same thing. The tension is between individual excellence and collective equality.

### 2. Democracy's Contradiction

Freedom built on exclusion. The *nothos* dies for a city that never fully claimed him. Women, slaves, metics, bastards — democracy was "rule by the people" for a narrow definition of "people."

Pheidippides saves a system that excluded him. That's not irony — that's the point. Democracy is worth dying for even when it fails you, because it's the beginning, not the end.

### 3. Kleos vs. Sacrifice

*Kleos* = glory for YOU. Your name lives forever. Achilles' choice.

Sacrifice = giving yourself for OTHERS. Your name doesn't matter. The gift does.

### 4. The Outsider

Only the excluded can save what excluded them. Pan is the outsider god — the wild, the liminal, the in-between. So is Pheidippides.

The *nothos* sees what citizens can't. He does what citizens won't.
