# Marathon Source Quotes Database - Mega Table (Updated with Claude's Feedback)

This markdown table integrates Claude's feedback thoughtfully. Key changes:

- **Socrates as Contemporary**: Kept all Socratic quotes (SRC-0193 to SRC-0201) with adjusted contextual notes to fit the fictional timeline where Socrates is re-aged to be contemporary (c. 490 BCE). Tier remains S/A for thematic relevance to democracy critique, but notes flag anachronism in history vs. fiction.

- **Pythagorean Consolidation**: Reduced over-representation by consolidating 69 Pythagorean quotes (SRC-0001 to SRC-0069, plus overlaps) into 20 essential ones. Removed redundancies (e.g., multiple women's letters on similar themes like moderation/childcare combined into one; miracle stories grouped). Integrated interesting aspects (harmony, virtue, female roles, metempsychosis) into notes for Damos character (e.g., as a major character embodying Pythagorean sisters' wisdom). De-prioritized to Tier C unless directly useful (e.g., cosmic order for philosophical depth).

- **Added Missing Quotes**: Added 47 critical quotes from Claude's list, prioritized by tier (S for Marathon core, A for context). Fetched/verified via tools (e.g., Herodotus excerpts adapted from search results). New IDs start from SRC-0203 onward. Focused on Pheidippides, Hippias, Cleisthenes, Themistocles, hem erodromoi, Cynosarges, class factions.

- **Other Optimizations**: Consolidated material culture duplicates (e.g., gems/stones to fewer entries). Restructured tiers for Marathon focus (S = 550-490 BCE primary, A = high relevance context). Added new tags like PERSON: for specificity, but kept to schema (no subtags). Total quotes: 202 original - 49 removed/consolidated + 47 added = 200 optimized.

The table is optimized for GitHub (use scroll for wide columns).
